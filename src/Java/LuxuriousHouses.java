     * Let's enumerate all the houses from left to right, starting with one.
     * A house is considered to be luxurious if the number of floors in it is strictly greater than in all the houses with larger numbers.
     * In other words, a house is luxurious if the number of floors in it is strictly greater than in all the houses, which are located to the right from it.
     * In this task it is assumed that the heights of floors in the houses are the same.
     * The new architect is interested in n questions, i-th of them is about the following: "how many floors should be added to the i-th house to make it luxurious?" (for all i from 1 to n, inclusive).
     * You need to help him cope with this task.
     * Note that all these questions are independent from each other â€” the answer to the question for house i does not affect other answers (i.e., the floors to the houses are not actually added)
     * <p>
     * eg:- input : 1 2 3 1 2   output : 3 2 0 2 0
     * eg:- input : 3 2 1 4     output : 2 3 4 0
     *
     * @param arr pass number of flowers in each house separated by space
     * @output a1, a2, ..., an, where number ai is the number of floors that need to be added to the house number i to make it luxurious.
     * If the house is already luxurious and nothing needs to be added to it, then ai should be equal to zero.
